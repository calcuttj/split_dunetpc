# split_dunetpc

These are bash scripts and template CMakeLists.txt files intended
for splitting dunetpc's repository into smaller pieces.
The scripts and tools in the first_try directory split
dunetpc v09_26_00 using directories available on one of the DUNE
build nodes.  mytest11build_newdev.sh checks out the unsplit
dunetpc code, and splitall.sh splits and builds as it goes along.
